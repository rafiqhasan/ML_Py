In this part of the exercise, you will implement regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant
passes quality assur-ance (QA). During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it is functioning correctly.

Suppose you are the product manager of the factory and you have the test results for some microchips on two dierent tests. From these two tests,
you would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected. To help you make the decision, you have a dataset of 
test results on past microchips, from which you can build a logistic regression model.

A logistic regression model will determine a mathematical boundary between the two classes: Passed and Failed microchips.
